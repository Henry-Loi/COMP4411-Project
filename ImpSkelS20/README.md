# Project 1 : Impressionist
> Assigned : Feb 3 \
Due : Mar 2   

## Basic Requirement

### List
1. Implement 5 different brush types: **single line, scattered lines, scattered points, (filled) circles, and scattered (filled) circles**. See the sample solution for an example of each brush's appearance. Note that **scattered brushes should sample from each location they color individually, not just use a single color for each splotch**.
   
2. Add sliders to control various brush attributes. You need to include sliders for the **line thickness and brush angle**, in addition to the existing **brush size** slider.
   
3. Add the ability to **control the brush direction**. The stroke direction should be controlled four different ways: using a **slider value**, using the **right mouse button to drag out a direction line**, using the **direction of the cursor movement**, and using **directions that are perpendicular to the gradient of the image**. You can use a radio box to allow the user to select which method to use.
   
4. Allow the user to **change the opacity (alpha value) of the brush stroke**. An alpha value slider should be added to the controls window.
